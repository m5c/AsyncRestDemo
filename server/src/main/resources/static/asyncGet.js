/**
 * Functionality related to repeated long polling on a resource.
 * As an ARL user you would typically call this function, to subscribe for updates on a given resource.
 *
 * How it works: Once launched recursive polls for updates, until the server relied with a 200 or non-408 return code.
 * That is to say:
 * If 200 was returned, the success function is called. Then new long polling is automatically started, based on the hash of the received content.
 * If 408 was returned, a subsequent long poll on the same resource is immediately fired.
 * If anything else was returned, the error function is called.
 * Credit for a good error-handling basis goes to:
